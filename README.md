Overview
This project aims to predict the closing stock prices of Reliance Industries using historical stock data. The model leverages the capabilities of LSTM neural networks to capture temporal dependencies and make informed predictions.

Dependencies
The project requires the following dependencies:

yfinance

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

scikit-learn

tensorflow

keras

Install the dependencies using the following command:

bash
pip install yfinance pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow
Data Collection
We use the yfinance library to download historical stock data for Reliance Industries from Yahoo Finance. The data ranges from January 1, 2010, to the current date.

Feature Engineering & Data Preparation
We create additional features such as the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, daily returns, and include trading volume. The data is then scaled and converted into sequences suitable for LSTM model training.

Model Building
The LSTM model is built using the tensorflow and keras libraries. The model consists of two LSTM layers, followed by dropout layers to prevent overfitting, and dense layers for prediction.

Model Training & Evaluation
The model is trained on 80% of the data, with 20% used for testing. We use early stopping, learning rate reduction, and model checkpoint callbacks to enhance the training process. The model's performance is evaluated using RMSE and MAE metrics.

Future Forecasting
We use the trained model to predict stock prices for the next 7 days, starting from the last available data point.

Results
The model's predictions are compared with the actual stock prices, and the results are visualized to assess the model's accuracy.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of LSTM neural networks in financial forecasting. While the model shows promise, it's important to approach stock price predictions with caution due to the inherent uncertainties in the market.
