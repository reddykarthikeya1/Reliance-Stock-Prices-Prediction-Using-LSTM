This project demonstrates the use of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict the closing prices of Reliance Industries Limited (RELIANCE.NS) stock. By leveraging historical stock data from Yahoo Finance, the model captures temporal dependencies to forecast future stock prices. The workflow includes data collection, feature engineering, model building, training, evaluation, and multi-step forecasting.
